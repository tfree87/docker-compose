Each of the directories above contains the following files:
- ~README.org~ : A file explaining the contents of each directory.
- ~docker-compose.org~ : A literate programming file that contains documentation of the elements in the ~docker-compose.yaml~ file. This file is /tangled/ to the ~docker-compose.yaml~ file and /generates/ the ~docker-compose.yaml~ file upon saving.
- ~docker-compose.yaml~ : A Docker compose file generated upon saving ~docker-compse.org~. *Note: It is recommended that you do not edit this file as this file was generated from the corresponding docker-compose.org file. Saving the docker-compse.org file will overwrite the contents of this file.*
