A series of Docker-Compose files used to run various containers on the Raspberry Pi 4.

* Contents
In this repository, each directory contains a ~docker-compose.yaml~ file for a separate Docker container.
** Directories
This repository contains the following directories
- [[file:./barcode_buddy/][barcode buddy]] :: A service that can pass barcodes to Grocy

** Directory Contents
Each of the directories above contains the following files:
- ~README.org~ :: A file explaining the contents of each directory.
- ~docker-compose.org~ :: A literate programming file that contains documentation of the elements in the ~docker-compose.yaml~ file. This file is /tangled/ to the ~docker-compose.yaml~ file and /generates/ the ~docker-compose.yaml~ file upon saving.
- ~docker-compose.yaml~ :: A Docker compose file generated upon saving ~docker-compse.org~. *Note: It is recommended that you do not edit this file as this file was generated from the corresponding docker-compose.org file. Saving the docker-compse.org file will overwrite the contents of this file.*
